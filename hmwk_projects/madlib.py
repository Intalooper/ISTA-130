Date: July 27th

Purpose: This program is meant to take in a file and output specific information about the contents of the file. In addition, it creates a new file using anohter file, replacing its keywords with user input. 
'''
'''
Step 1: ask for input 
Step 2: replace the missing words with the input 
Step 3: traverse throught the file 
    I believe at this pooint i will have to identify some of the key terms and then replace thme with the user input 
    Here are the key terms: 
        1: NOUN 
        2: PLURAL NOUN
        3: VERB
        4: VERB PAST 
        5: ADJECTIVE 
Step 4: Create a new file and replace the old file with the new user input in place of the key terms
Step 5: Print a numerical analysis of the contents of the file 
'''
def print_report(file_name):
    '''
    Purpose: Reade the given file and print a report of the following information: 
        a. number of vowels 
        b. number of consanants 
        c. number of whitespaces 
        d. number of punctuation characters (not white space or not a letter)
        f. percent of the file composed of vowels, consanants, white spaces, and puncuation characters
        g. begin and end with a blank line

    Purpose: Replaces all parts of speech labels in a file with words that are entered by the user onto a new file.
        personal note:
            you will need to use the replace parts of speech funciton and my guess is that i will have to run it fro every line in the function 
             rule to follow:
                You will need to replace the words in the following order: 
                    1.Plural Noun
                     2. Verb Past
                      3. Verb
                       4. Noun
                        5. Adjective

My understanding is that this would require a large language model or a very large list of dictionaries that aligns with every part of speech.

#Feedback for the code above
# Suggestions for Improvement:

# Expand Parameter Documentation: Be more descriptive about what each parameter does and expects. For instance, specify the expected format if there are any constraints on the input.
# Include Return Values: Document what each function returns, especially if it's not immediately obvious from the context.
# Error Handling: Mention how your code handles errors or unexpected inputs, which is crucial for developers to understand its robustness.
# Examples: Where applicable, include simple usage examples in the docstrings.
